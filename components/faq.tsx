            <AccordionTrigger>How do I create Work on Gibwork?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Open the app and use the create flow to publish an open source
              bounty, simple task, or service request. Add the reward,
              instructions, deadline, and the proof you need contributors to
              submit.

              What&apos;s the difference between a bounty and a task?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              A bounty is tied to a GitHub issue and is usually completed with a
              pull request. A task is a scoped deliverable such as research,
              design, content, testing, or feedback.

              Submit the required proof for the task or bounty. Once the creator
              approves your submission, the reward is released to your wallet.
