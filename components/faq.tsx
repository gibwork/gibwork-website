              What&apos;s the difference between a bounty and a task?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              A bounty is a Github issue with a monetary reward.  A task is a
              specific, often smaller job that needs to be completed.

              Once your work is approved by the creator, the funds will be released. Ensure
              your wallet is connected and has a minimum amount of SOL on Solana mainnet to claim your
              rewards. Navigate to the Dashbaord, find your submission, click &quot;Claim Rewards,&quot; and the
              amount will be transferred to your wallet shortly.
