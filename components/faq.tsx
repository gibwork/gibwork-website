            <AccordionTrigger>How do I create Work on Gibwork?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Under the earnings display on the apps home page, click the
              &quot;Create&quot; buttons for creating Open Source Bounties and Task. These buttons guide you through the process of creating and posting jobs on the
              platform.

              What&apos;s the difference between a bounty and a task?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              A bounty is a Github issue with a monetary reward.  A task is a
              specific, often smaller job that needs to be completed.

            <AccordionTrigger>What payment methods does gibwork support?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Gibwork is fully onchain. Payouts are sent directly to your
              noncustodial Solana wallet in USDC or any other Solana SPL token
              the creator chose to fund the work with.

            <AccordionTrigger>Is there a mobile app?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Yes — the Gibwork app is available on both the App Store and
              Google Play. You can browse bounties, submit work, track
              approvals, and manage USDC payouts from your phone.

              How do I know a bounty will actually pay out?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Funds are escrowed onchain the moment a creator publishes work.
              You can confirm the escrow on Solana before you start. Once your
              submission is approved, the smart contract releases payment to
              your wallet automatically.
